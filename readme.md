JTAG adapter: 20-pin ARM to Cortex SWD w/ 10-pin 0.05" or 6-pin Tag Connect
===

This design has not yet been tested!
I'll upload gerbers after confirming that it works.

The repo started out as a "universal adapter", which became somewhat intractable...
However, in that attempt I accumulated a few JTAG pinout links:
